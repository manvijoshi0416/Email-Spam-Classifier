# Email-Spam-Classifier

**📜Project Overview**

Developed an Email Spam Classifier that predicts whether an email is spam or not using machine learning techniques. The application processes email text data with TF-IDF vectorization and leverages the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm for classification. A user-friendly web application is built using Streamlit to allow real-time predictions.

**🔑Key Features**

*TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts text data into numerical form for effective feature extraction.

*Multinomial Naive Bayes: Implements this supervised learning algorithm for accurate email classification.

*Streamlit Web App: Provides a simple and interactive interface to input email text and display predictions instantly.

*Efficient Text Preprocessing: Removes stopwords and tokenizes the input to optimize classification accuracy.

**🛠️Tech Stack**

*Programming Language: Python

*Libraries/Frameworks: Scikit-learn, Streamlit, Pandas

*Text Processing: TF-IDF

*Algorithm: Multinomial Naive Bayes

**🚀How to Run**

*Clone the repository.

*Install the required packages listed in requirements.txt.

*Run the Streamlit app using streamlit run app.py.
